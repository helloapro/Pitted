    <h3>BACKSTORY</h3>
      <p>Pitted stemmed from the one hungover Saturday when Ronald Peters chipped his front tooth, biting too far into a peach. As he stood with droplets of pain tears welled in his eyes, he had the revelation that in the center of every juicy peach, lies a hard pit -- that's the true core: the beginning of every fruitful venture.</p>
